## Demo

[Live Demo](https://weather-app-zeta-three-62.vercel.app/)

## Installation (Local Setup)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).**

3. **Open `script.js` and add your API key:**

   At the top of the file, replace:
   ```js
   // import { apiKey } from './config.js';
   ```

   With:
   ```js
   const apiKey = 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY';
   ```

4. **Update API fetch URLs in `script.js`:**

   Replace all occurrences of:
   ```js
   /api/weather?type=weather&lat=...&lon=...&units=...
   ```

   With:
   ```js
   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=...&lon=...&units=...&appid=${apiKey}
   ```

   Replace:
   ```js
   /api/weather?type=geo&q=...
   ```

   With:
   ```js
   https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=...&limit=5&appid=${apiKey}
   ```

   And:
   ```js
   /api/weather?type=reverse&lat=...&lon=...
   ```

   With:
   ```js
   https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/reverse?lat=...&lon=...&limit=1&appid=${apiKey}
   ```

5. **Serve the project locally:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Or use any static server like Live Server in VS Code.

6. **Visit the app in your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

üîê **Note:** This setup directly embeds your API key in the frontend for local testing. For production, it's recommended to use a backend proxy (`/api/weather`) to keep your API key hidden.

## Deployment (Vercel)
